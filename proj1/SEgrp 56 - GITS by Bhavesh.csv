Item,Assessment,Evidence
Video,2,"Video explians what it is intented to do, but could have provided example commands in GIT and GITS to differentiate the extent to GITS simplifies our job"
"Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)",1,https://github.com/bhavesh242/GITS/graphs/contributors. There is a huge descrepency in the person with highest number of commits and person with lowest number of commits
Number of commits,2,"Over 214+ commits in the moth of September and October, spread over 10 teammates. But commits are done together in a few days (7 days in total), doesn't show an incremental development"
Number of commits: by different people,1,Commits count are ranging between 4 to 54. Few of the teammates have significantly low commits count
Issues reports: there are many,1,"17 issues have been raised, opened and closed in 2 days"
Issues are being closed,1,all issues closed in 1 day
DOI badge: exists,3,Badges exist
"Docs: doco generated, format not ugly",2,some mistakes in doc. Creating a new branch is wrongly mentioned in doc. Found difficult to start with as it doesnt mention dependency with GIT anywhere
Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation),3,Decently documented
"Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z",2,No mini tutorials or worked examples
"Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing",2,not convincing enough to make me move from GIT
"Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.",1,Nothing related to this in the video
Use of version control tools,2,Actions could have been used to simply the setup
Use of style checkers,2,steps to use exists. could have automated the check
Use of code formatters.,0,not seen anywhere
Use of syntax checkers.,0,Not present
Use of code coverage,2,".cov file exists, but cov.html not seen. Percentage of coverage is not found"
Other automated analysis tools,2,
Test cases exist,2,"Decent count of test cases, not all cases are covered."
Test cases are routinely executed,0,Not executed
The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up,3,Explanation present. https://github.com/bhavesh242/GITS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
Issues are discussed before they are closed,1,"No discussions seen, just explanations by self"
Chat channel: exists,1,No chat channel exists
Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases,1,No https://github.com/bhavesh242/GITS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files,2,
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)",1,No evidence found
"Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)",2,No such evidence. but looks straight forward to run in all systems
Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base,2,major functionality of the code has been contributed only by a couple of contributors
