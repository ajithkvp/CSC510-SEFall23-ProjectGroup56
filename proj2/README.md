- This link has all the significant changes implemented in the GITS project repository: https://github.com/ajithkvp/GITS

### New commands added as part of modifications to GITS:
**1. **gits commit_with_test****
This is a slightly advanced version of git commit command. This commands checks for the success of the unit test cases, before performing the commit. If all the test cases are passed, the commit will be done successfully. In case of failure of the test cases, this command gives the user a choice to take a call on whether the commit needs to be done or it needs to be aborted.

**2. **gits stats****
This command extends the functionality of Git by providing a command to view user statistics, including commit count, insertions, and deletions. It parses the Git log and presents the data in a tabular format, making it easy to analyze the contributions of different authors to a Git repository.

**3. gits tag**
The 'gits tag' command extends the functionality of 'git tag' command in Git which is used to list all the tags (references to specific points in Git history) in a repository. Tags are typically used to mark important points, such as releases or milestones, in a project's history. Tags are commonly used to provide a human-readable and easily accessible reference to a specific commit.

**4. gits tag <tag_name>**
The gits tag <tag_name> command is used to create a new tag with a specific name at the current commit in a Git repository. This allows you to mark a significant point in your project's history, such as a software release or a specific version. Tags are lightweight and do not move as you make new commits.

**5. gits checkout <tag_name>**
The gits checkout <tag_name> command is used to switch the Git repository to a specific tagged commit. This means that it moves your working directory and HEAD (current branch) to the commit associated with the specified tag. It's a way to work on a specific version of your project, effectively creating a detached HEAD state. This is useful for inspecting, testing, or making changes related to a particular release or point in your project's history without affecting the current branch.

**6. gits describe**
This command in Git is used to provide a human-readable name for a specific commit. It's often used to get a descriptive label for a commit, such as a version number or release name. This can be helpful for identifying and communicating the state of a particular commit in your Git repository.

**7. gits commit_tree**
This command produces a visual representation of the commit history that makes it easier to understand the branching and merging of different branches in a Git repository. This can be especially useful for complex projects with multiple contributors or when working with feature branches and merges. The graph lines connect commits to show the sequence of commits and how they are related, helping you to visualize the history of your project more clearly.


### Future Scope:
Make GITS - Windows Compatible
Supporting lesser known functions
Supporting Trivial git functions
